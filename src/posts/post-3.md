Dirt rail trails offer a relaxing experience for cyclists who love connecting with  nature. The soft ground often provides a quieter ride compared to a paved bike path, letting you soak in the sounds of the forest and  farmland. Dirt paths challenge your skills with varied terrain, making every ride a unique  journey.

The Corry Greenway Trail is a dirt trail that starts on Route 426 north of route 6 in Corry, Pa, and goes to  Clymer, New York. It is an interesting trail that allows you to ride in two  states. It is only about 7 miles to Clymer, New York, on the  trail.

My brother and I started at the parking lot next to Route 6 in Corry, Pa, next to the Subway  shop. There is also a parking lot on Route 426 next to the trail  head. The first part of the trail is a gravel-dirt mix, which is easy to ride on with any city bike, gravel bike, or mountain  bike. There are some short pave sections next to some of the road  Crossing. There also a dirt parking lot on Hereford Road on the Pennsylvania  side

The trail starts out as a hard-packed gravel dirt trail, then changes to a softer gravel dirt  trail. Last year, they extended the gravel dirt mix to  Simmonds Road. There is no longer large or small gravel on most of the  trail. The trail offers a mixture of farmland and wooded areas to ride  through. After Simmonds Road, the trail changes to a mix of dirt and  grass.

Near Clymer, there is a bridge over a tributary to Brokenstraw Creek, which I helped build in the early  2000s. with the North West Pennsylvania Trail Association

We met a trail volunteer along the  way. He takes care of the birdhouses along the  trail. He told us about the history of the  trail. The trail is part of the Erie Pittsburgh  Trail. He also told us about a new trail they are working on--the Erie to Corry Trail--with a trail head in Union  City. He was very interesting to listen to as he shared stories about the  trail
