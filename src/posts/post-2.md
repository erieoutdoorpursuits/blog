# Trail Report: Pymatuning Greenway Trail

About five miles of the Pymatuning Valley Greenway Trail were completed in fall 2024. This trail system is 5.2 miles long, going from Leon Road in Andover Township to Maple Avenue in Andover, then picking back up on Mill Street and heading south to Marvin Road.

My brother Ray and I did the southern portion of the trail first. It started on Mill Street next to the Andover Christian Church. I called the church, and they let us park in their parking lot to ride the trail. This section was paved for about two miles. After that, it went through a farmer's garden and turned to dirt. We rode on the dirt section until it got too muddy to ride.

We then drove to the northern section located on Maple Avenue next to the Andover Village Hall (police station). There were a few parking spots at the Village Hall where you could park. There was a larger parking lot at Leon Road at the end of the paved trail. The trail was mostly flat, going through farmers' gardens and wooded terrain. This section was about 3.2 miles of pavement, from Maple Avenue to Leon Road. After Leon Road, the trail was shut off because of vegetation and fallen trees.

This trail will extend in the future from the Pennsylvania border to Jefferson, Ohio, when finished. But for now, it is only 5.2 miles in total, with 2 miles for the southern section and 3.2 miles in the northern section.
